# Retrieves the text under the selection, without polluting the registers.
# This is easier if we could yank, but we don't know what the user has been
# doing. One way we could have accomplished this was to save the register info
# and then restore it, but this runs into problems if the unnamed register was
# pointing to the "* register as setting and restoring the system clipboard
# could be iffy (if there are non-text items in the clipboard). It's cleaner
# to just use a pure Vimscript solution without having to rely on yank.
